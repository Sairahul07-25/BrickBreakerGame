# Java Brick Breaker Game

A classic Brick Breaker game implemented in Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles, Java Swing GUI, event handling, and game development concepts.

## Features

- Complete game loop implementation with collision detection
- Object-oriented design with inheritance and encapsulation
- Smooth animations and physics
- Progressive difficulty with colored brick rows
- Score tracking and multiple lives
- Realistic ball physics with angle-based paddle deflection
- Visual effects including 3D-style rendering for game elements

## How to Play

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move the paddle
- **Goal**: Break all bricks to win
- **Lives**: You have 3 lives - don't let the ball fall off the bottom!
- **Space**: Restart the game after winning or losing

## Technical Highlights

### Object-Oriented Design
- Abstract `GameObject` base class
- Specialized implementations for `Paddle`, `Ball`, and `Brick` classes
- Encapsulation of behavior and properties within each game object

### Java Swing Implementation
- Custom JPanel for game rendering
- Double buffering for smooth animations
- Anti-aliasing for improved graphics quality

### Physics and Collision Detection
- Rectangle-based collision detection
- Realistic ball bounce physics based on paddle hit position
- Side detection for brick collisions to determine appropriate bounce angle

### Game Loop Architecture
- Timer-based game loop for consistent updates
- Separation of update and render operations
- State management for game flow control

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any IDE that supports Java (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.)

## How to Run

1. Compile the game:
```
javac BrickBreaker.java
```

2. Run the game:
```
java BrickBreaker
```

## Game Structure

The game consists of the following main components:

- `BrickBreaker`: Main class and entry point
- `GamePanel`: Game loop and rendering logic
- `GameObject`: Base class for all game objects
- `Paddle`: Player-controlled paddle
- `Ball`: Ball with physics-based movement
- `Brick`: Destructible brick with point value

## Game Mechanics

- The ball bounces at different angles depending on where it hits the paddle
- Bricks in higher rows are worth more points
- The game ends when all bricks are destroyed or when all lives are lost

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Power-up system
- [ ] Multiple levels with different brick layouts
- [ ] High score persistence
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] Enhanced visual effects
